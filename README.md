### Special thanks
* Skillbert, for creating Alt1 and providing the tools and libraries to create third-party applications.
* Dala/Daladen, for providing me with an insight and reference into how the Summit Clue Logger worked to help write the original OpenLogger project and general web dev help.
* Athabastyx, for the technical help and Javascript insight. OpenLogger was my first JS/TS project and Atha helped a lot with helping me understand new functions, libraries, and how to optimize things better.
* All the people I've reached out to and have provided help regarding JS/TS and Alt1 plugin questions through the [Runeapps Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/G3SbcS8) and DMs.
* Everyone reaching out to report bugs and make suggestions. <br><br>
